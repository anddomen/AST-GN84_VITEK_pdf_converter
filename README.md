# AST-GN84_VITEK_pdf_converter
Script that takes output PDFs from the VITEK 2 Compact for the AST-GN84 card and converts them to useable csv.

Place all exported PDF's into one folder and use this script to turn them into a useable csv. This is specifically for the AST-GN84 VITEK card. The other information the script needs is what you want the output csv to be named and the filepath where you want it to go.
